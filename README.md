# Library Management in Flask
A local library is in dire need of a web application to ease their work. The library management system must allow a librarian to track books and their quantity, books issued to members, book fees.

For the sake of simplicity, you don't have to implement sessions and roles, you can assume that the app will be used by the librarian only.
